## Code Coverage

This project has unit tests in place to ensure a good coverage of the codebase. Here are the code coverage metrics:

| Metric               | Badge                                              |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Branches Coverage    | ![Branches Coverage](./coverage/badge-branches.svg)   |
| Functions Coverage   | ![Functions Coverage](./coverage/badge-functions.svg) |
| Lines Coverage       | ![Lines Coverage](./coverage/badge-lines.svg)         |
| Statements Coverage  | ![Statements Coverage](./coverage/badge-statements.svg)|

A higher coverage percentage indicates that more parts of the code have been tested, reducing the likelihood of undiscovered bugs and improving the overall code quality.
